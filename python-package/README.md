# Scroll Art

Scroll art is moving ASCII art produced by stdout text printed from a loop, "animated" as the text scrolls up the terminal.

"Scroll art" was coined by Al Sweigart. The simplicity of scroll art means that it's useful as a programming project for beginners. Scroll art can be made in any programming language. This package contains a large collection of scroll art, as well as functions for creating your own scroll art. You can see examples of scroll art at https://scrollart.com
